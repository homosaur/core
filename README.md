# Code for the People
This repository is the core repository for Code for the People (CftP). It's documents are living and tracked on github for historical purposes, and to allow easy change requests and discussion on changes.

# Our mission statement
We teach, develop, and advise political causes, candidates, and organizations on technology. We wish to utilize our unique skillset as software developers for our political activism.

# Who are we?
We are an inclusive group of programmers with similar political beliefs.

# Why
We believe that America is capable of so much more than it is now, and formed in a time of the rise of fascism in our government. We believe that technology enables an amplification of ability, and that if we apply ourselves to our beliefs with our skills, can do more good for our country.

# The details

## Projects

This space will eventually link out to known projects for CftP. For now, we're still organizing the basics.

## Code of Conduct

We have a code of conduct within this repos that we expect all members to adhere to. If you have additions or changes you wish to see in the code of conduct, we accept pull requests as open discussions on the group.
